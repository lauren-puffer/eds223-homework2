# Exploring patterns of environmental injustice

Environmental inequities can be seen all over the world. When low income, often non-white residents disproportionately take on environmental hazards, they often experience adverse health effects and environmental degradation in their neighborhoods. This repository contains scripts wthatwere used to explore how the historic practice of redlining has influenced the environmental harms experienced by residents in Los Angeles.

In 1933, the Home Owner's Loan Corporation created maps of metropolitan areas in the United States and categorized neighborhoods by grade. The grades were: A - best, B - still desirable, C - declining, and D - hazardous. This process has become know as "redlining." We aim to see how redlining continues to impact the residents of Los Angeles based on their demographic makeup and the environmental injustices they face. We will do this using patial data of historically redlined neighborhoods and demographic and environmental hazard data from EJ Screen.

This repository also examinines the concept that biological surveys conducted by community members are more prevalent in grade A neighborhoods, than in grade D neighborhoods. To do this we will use data from the Global Biodiveristy Information Facility gathered from eBird, a community science platform for bird observations.
